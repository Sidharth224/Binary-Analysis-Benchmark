# FirmBench: A Benchmark Suite for Binary Analysis
FirmBench is a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for binary analysis. FirmBench is meticulously curated to offer a wide array of scenarios and challenges, thoroughly evaluating the capabilities of security analysis tools. This repository aims to contribute significantly to the advancement of firmware security analysis, providing developers with a reliable and versatile benchmark for assessing the effectiveness of their tools. FirmBench stands out from existing benchmarks due to its unique features, including the provision of source code, structured metadata, utilization of complex peripheral libraries and inclusion of samples with specific CVEs injected into framework of SDKs. FirmBench was put through numerous analyses using a wide array of static and dynamic tools. Through our characterization process, we have demonstrated that FirmBench is suitable for evaluating various state-of-the-art static and dynamic analysis tools. Furthermore, the benchmark enables testing tools with distinct combinations of operating systems (OS), architectures, micro-controller units (MCUs) and peripherals. 
FirmBench is designed to have 3 benchmarks, each serving a different purpose and they are as follows,
* The Unit Test Benchmark comprises firmware that has been compiled using various software development kits (SDKs), incorporating feasible combinations of architecture, boards and peripheral libraries. This benchmark serves as a valuable resource for researchers, enabling them to gain insights into the firmware's interactions with registers and peripherals, and subsequently evaluate their tools accordingly.
* The Security Benchmark comprises a curated collection of firmware that contains vulnerabilities complied using Zephyr and Contiki-NG SDKs. These samples can be used by researchers to recreate the crash and validate how tools perform when a vulnerability is detected.
* The Real-World Benchmark is a compilation of open-source firmware obtained from vendors of different embedded systems, as well as firmware extracted from benchmarks made available in different static and dynamic tool’s repositories. This benchmark provides a realistic representation of firmware encountered in practical scenarios, allowing researchers to assess their tools and techniques on authentic and relevant samples.
